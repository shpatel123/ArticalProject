    {
      q: "What makes Scenic Eclipse different from other luxury cruises?",
      a: "Scenic Eclipse is a discovery yacht, not a traditional cruise ship. The experience is designed around exploration, enrichment, and destination depth rather than onboard entertainment or volume sightseeing. It combines expedition capability with refined luxury in a smaller-ship environment.",
    },
    {
      q: "Is Scenic Eclipse considered expedition travel?",
      a: "Yes. Scenic Eclipse operates in the expedition and discovery travel space. While the onboard experience is highly comfortable, itineraries often involve remote regions, expert-led excursions, and flexible daily planning shaped by weather and local conditions.",
    },
    {
      q: "Do I need to be physically fit to travel on Scenic Eclipse?",
      a: "Scenic Eclipse offers a range of activity levels. Some excursions involve light walking, while others may be more active. Choosing the right itinerary and activity profile is an important part of planning, and guidance helps ensure expectations are aligned with comfort and mobility.",
    },
    {
      q: "Are prices higher when booking Scenic Eclipse through a travel agency?",
      a: "No. Scenic Eclipse pricing is the same whether you book directly with the cruise line or through a qualified travel agency. Working with an agency adds planning expertise and support without increasing the cruise cost.",
    },
    {
      q: "Is it better to book Scenic Eclipse direct or through a travel advisor?",
      a: "Booking direct secures the sailing. Working with a travel advisor helps design and support the entire journey, including itinerary alignment, seasonality guidance, cabin selection, travel coordination, and ongoing support before and after the trip.",
    },
    {
      q: "Will I receive the same onboard experience if I book through Trips & Ships Luxury Travel?",
      a: "Yes. Booking through Trips & Ships does not change the onboard experience in any way. It enhances the journey by providing expert planning and concierge-level support outside of the ship.",
    },
    {
      q: "What destinations does Scenic Eclipse travel to?",
      a: "Scenic Eclipse sails to polar regions, remote destinations, and select warm-water regions depending on the season. Itineraries may include Antarctica, the Arctic, South America, the South Pacific, and other destinations not accessible to traditional cruise ships.",
    },
    {
      q: "How important is seasonality when choosing a Scenic Eclipse itinerary?",
      a: "Seasonality is critical. Weather, wildlife activity, daylight hours, and sea conditions all influence the overall experience. Thoughtful planning ensures the timing of the journey aligns with what travelers hope to see and experience.",
    },
    {
      q: "How do I choose the right cabin on Scenic Eclipse?",
      a: "Cabin selection involves more than choosing a category. Location on the ship, deck placement, proximity to amenities, and overall ship flow all matter. Strategic guidance helps select a cabin that best fits comfort preferences and travel style.",
    },
    {
      q: "Is travel insurance recommended for Scenic Eclipse trips?",
      a: "Yes. Because Scenic Eclipse itineraries often involve remote or expedition-style travel, comprehensive travel insurance is strongly recommended. Coverage should be appropriate for the destination and nature of the journey.",
    },
    {
      q: "What happens if itineraries or daily plans change?",
      a: "Discovery yacht travel allows for flexibility. Weather and local conditions may influence daily plans. With experienced planning and support, adjustments are handled smoothly and communicated clearly so the experience remains positive and well-paced.",
    },
    {
      q: "Who will I work with when booking Scenic Eclipse through Trips & Ships Luxury Travel?",
      a: "You will work directly with Angela Hughes, CEO and Founder of Trips & Ships Luxury Travel. Angela personally guides the planning process for Scenic Eclipse journeys, ensuring itinerary selection, seasonality, cabin strategy, and travel details are thoughtfully aligned from the start.",

                Planning a Scenic Eclipse journey requires a different level of
                expertise than traditional luxury cruising. Discovery yachts
                operate in remote regions, follow expedition-style pacing, and
                are shaped by seasonality, weather, and regional conditions.
