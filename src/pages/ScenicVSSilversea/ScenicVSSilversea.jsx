            <p>
              Scenic Eclipse was built as a discovery yacht designed
              specifically for senianta-expedition environments. The onboard
              experience is modern, with open spaces, multiple dining venues,
              and a contemporary layout.
            </p>

            <p>
              Silversea's senianta-expedition ships reflect the brand's heritage
              in luxury cruising, combining senianta-expedition capability with
              a more classic onboard environment.
